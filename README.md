# Why Yet another application

As a passionate movie buff, I understand the joy and excitement of diving into a captivating film. However, the hassle of switching between different streaming services or dealing with platform restrictions can sometimes dampen the experience. That's why I developed the Whale Stream.

# More than application

What began as a Mac application has now evolved into a multi-platform desktop app that I am currently developing.

### Troubleshooting

- Whale Stream canâ€™t be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

  - Get error prompts such as broken files with Apple Silicon machines. Open `Terminal.app` and enter the following command (you may need to enter a password halfway through), then restart `Whale Stream`:

    ```sh
    sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Whale\ Stream.app
    ```
